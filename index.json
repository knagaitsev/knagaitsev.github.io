My research interests mainly lie in compiler support for parallel computing and machine learning. Recently, my work has focused on understanding and improving LLM-based systems for performance engineering tasks (e.g. PyTorch inference optimization).\nI received my undergraduate degree in computer science from University of Chicago, where I was advised by Ian Foster and Kyle Chard as part of Globus Labs. While there, I was involved in FaaS (Function as a Service) research, and I made significant contributions to the Globus Compute platform (previously known as funcX).\nI am a proponent of open source software, with significant contributions to the widely used webpack-dev-server (10M+ weekly downloads on npm). I started contributing as part of the webpack GSoC (Google Summer of Code) program in 2019, and later worked as a freelance webpack-dev-server maintainer.\nIn my free time, I enjoy game development, and have published a number of popular multiplayer games [Oldwest.io, Cavegame.io, MineRoyale.io]. I\u0026rsquo;m also generally interested in operating systems and system security, outside of my normal research.
