I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate and DOE CSGF fellow at Northwestern University, advised by [Peter Dinda](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/dinda-peter.html) as part of the [Prescience Lab](https://plab.cs.northwestern.edu/). My research interests mainly lie in compiler support for parallel computing and machine learning. Recently, my work has focused on understanding and improving LLM-based systems for performance engineering tasks (e.g. PyTorch inference optimization).

I received my undergraduate degree in computer science from University of Chicago, where I was advised by [Ian Foster](https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/people/ian-foster/) and [Kyle Chard](https://kylechard.com/) as part of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/). While there, I was involved in FaaS (Function as a Service) research, and I helped develop the [Globus Compute](https://github.com/globus/globus-compute) platform (previously known as funcX).

I'm a big advocate of open source software, with substantial contributions to the widely used [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (10M+ weekly downloads [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)). I started contributing as part of the [webpack GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/5974651593818112) (Google Summer of Code) program in 2019, and later worked as a freelance webpack-dev-server maintainer.

In my free time, I enjoy game development, and have published a number of popular multiplayer games [[Oldwest.io](https://oldwest.io), [Cavegame.io](https://cavegame.io), [MineRoyale.io](https://mineroyale.io)]. I'm also generally interested in operating systems, networking, and system security outside of my normal research. You can read more about my work and other miscellaneous interests on [my blog](/blog/)!
